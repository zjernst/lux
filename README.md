## Goal

You find yourself in a mysterious surroundings. The land around you seems to
shift without cause. The night is setting in and the light is fading. At least
you brought a flashlight.

Once the screen fades to black, the player has only a small cone of vision.
You move around by pressing W-A-S-D while their flashlight points towards
the mouse. Try to navigate the map to find a Red Portal to take you to the next
area. The only thing that stands between you is a randomly-generated and shifting
terrain and a legion of ghosts that builds as you progress further. How long
can you survive?
